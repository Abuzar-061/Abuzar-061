Hello, I'm Muhammad Abuzar, welcome to my Github. What a pleasure it must be for you to see such beautiful code, in every repo! Ha, just kidding, don't go snooping around though - there's a lot that I'm not proud of. 

So, I am a software engineer by trade currently working at [ContentArcade](https://www.contentarcade.com/) predominantly writing Python and Angular. In my spare time I do a bit of hacking as you may see from the odd commit here on Github.
